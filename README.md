## How to Get Bot Token and Client ID

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a new application
3. Go to the "Bot" section and create a bot
4. Copy the bot token and add it to your `.env` file as `DISCORD_TOKEN`
5. From the "General Information" section, copy the "Application ID" and add it to your `.env` file as `CLIENT_ID`
6. Invite the bot to your server using the OAuth2 URL generator with the `applications.commands` scope

## Notes

- Each user starts with 1000 coins
- Only one match can be active at a time
- Slash commands may take up to an hour to appear after the bot starts due to Discord's global command registration
